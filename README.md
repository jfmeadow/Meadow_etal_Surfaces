These scripts detail statistical analysis of bacterial communities found on classroom surfaces. 

#### Updated Aug 5, 2014

One function, `indval` appears to have changed since publication, and now requires ordinal variables instead of factors. So I updated this command appropriately. This is a minor technicality, and the results did not change. *I did not update the `Additional_File_2.pdf` so as to preserve the exact document that was submitted with the manuscript.* 

I also updated the configuration information at the top of the file to reflect the changes in the Rmarkdown package, so that the script will run in all current versions of RStudio. Also no change in results.
